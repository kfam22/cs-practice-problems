# cs-practice-problems
A collection of problems I've encountered and worked through to practice DS&A principles.

To quickly run the solution code and see if your answers match the expected outcome of the provided test cases, intall the Quokka extension in VScode.  
After installing, click cmd + shift + p (or ctrl + shift + p on a pc) and click Quokka.js:Start on Current File
Make sure that your solution function is invoked with the correct test paramaters and Quokka will show you what your function returns or console logs in line with your code.

For more details on how to easily see the results of your code with Quokka and test against different test cases check out the following video:
