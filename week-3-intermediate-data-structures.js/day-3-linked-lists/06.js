// Description

// Given a list and a value, append the value to the end of the list.

// You have to wrap the value into a ListNode() object.

// JavaScript:

// const new_node = new ListNode(n);

// Python:

// new_node = ListNode(n)

// You do not need to uncomment the ListNode code in the header. That's just there for your reference.

// Note the the tests will show the linked lists as if they are arrays. This is just the visual representation; under the hood, it's a linked list with those values.

// Return a reference to the head of the list.
